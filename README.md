# SQL Portfolio Project Covid Data Exploration

## Introduction:

This is a SQL Portfolio Project conducting Data Exploration on this [Covid Dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

## Method:

- For this project, I followed [Alex the Analyst's Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM)
- My dataset has data that is more recent than Alex's in his video
- Due to different dataset import methods to Alex, I had to do some corrections to the dataset before beginning to be able to follow his instructions
- After following his guide I conducted my own independent exploration of the dataset focusing on Southeast Asian countries

## Other Methods:

- Upon completing this project, I posted a [blog](https://miqbalhalid.wixsite.com/iqbalhalid/post/sql-portfolio-project-covid-19-data-exploration) on my website describing my thought process and techniques used
